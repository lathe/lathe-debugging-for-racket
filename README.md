# Lathe Debugging for Racket

[![Travis build](https://travis-ci.org/lathe/lathe-debugging-for-racket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lathe/lathe-debugging-for-racket)

Lathe Debugging for Racket is a small collection of utilities that are handy for debugging Racket code. This is a very ad hoc library, and the interface is subject to change.


## Installation and use

This is a library for Racket. To install it, run `raco pkg install --deps search-auto` from the `lathe-debugging-lib/` directory, and then put an import like `(require lathe-debugging)` in your Racket program.

The interface to Lathe Debugging is very tentative and unstable, but it is documented in the `lathe-debugging-doc/` package's documentation.
